# ChunkFarmer
Chunk Farmer is a chunk-specific farming automation plugin.
- A player places a configurable block to where they're standing, which would enable the chunk to make use of the automation process
- Chests appear either at the location of the aforementioned placed block, or wherever the player specifies them to be
- The plugin will check each time a block is broken, or an item is dropped, and will automatically sort them into the specified chests
- The speed and efficiency of this process will be configurable and upgradeable with the use of Vault as the base for the economy
- If all designated chests are full, the rest of the items which don't fit anymore will be deleted
